To-Do List App Goal: Build a functional to-do list with add, delete, and filter options. Topics Covered:
HTML: Lists and inputs. CSS: Animations and transitions. JavaScript: DOM manipulation, local storage. Instructions:

HTML Structure: Include an input field for new tasks, an Add Task button, and a list for displaying tasks. CSS Styling: Use animations (e.g., fade in/out) for adding and removing tasks. Style completed tasks with a strikethrough effect. JavaScript Functionality: Implement add, delete, and mark-complete features. Store tasks in local storage so they persist on reload. Add a filter to show All, Completed, or Pending tasks. Bonus: Allow drag-and-drop to reorder tasks.
